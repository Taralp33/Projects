# Zero to Cloud: Enterprise Network #

## Executive Summary
This project involved building a secure enterprise network from scratch, including setting up a domain controller, managing users via PowerShell, and connecting Windows machines. The network was integrated with Azure AD for centralized management, with security policies enforced and devices onboarded to Intune and Microsoft Defender. The result is a secure, scalable hybrid network leveraging both on-premises and cloud technologies.

## Introduction
Background: The project addressed the need for a robust and secure enterprise network infrastructure from scratch. The goal was to integrate on-premises resources with cloud technologies, ensuring centralized management, efficient user provisioning, and enhanced security for organizational needs.
  
Objectives:  
-Build an enterprise network with a domain controller and connected Windows machines.

-Automate user creation and management using PowerShell.

-Integrate the domain controller with Azure Active Directory for centralized identity and access management.

-Deploy and enforce security policies to safeguard user accounts and devices.

-Onboard devices to Intune for unified endpoint management.

Implement Microsoft Defender for advanced threat protection.
## Project Details
 Services Used:
   Examples: Azure Entra ID, Azure Entra Connect, Azure VMs, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Oracle VBOX, Windows VM, Server
              2019, UML. 

## Outcomes and Results
Created a Fully integrated hybrid enterprise environment with SSO on the cloud and onboarded Onpremesis devices.

## Lessons Learned
It's important to emphasize the need for thoroughly assessing system integration requirements and leveraging a variety of online resources to address challenges effectively. Troubleshooting connection issues often involves carefully examining system dependencies and their configurations to ensure seamless interoperability and functionality.

## Future Recommendations
I aim to design and implement a fully operational enterprise network infrastructure, integrating advanced cybersecurity solutions to enhance security and efficiency. Key initiatives include leveraging advanced log analysis, Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and response, AI-driven automation for streamlined operations, and Zero Trust architecture to fortify access management. Additionally, I plan to integrate Defender for Cloud for comprehensive cloud protection and deploy a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solution to automate workflows and improve incident response capabilities.
